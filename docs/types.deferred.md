## Deferred class

A deferred represents some asynchronous work that is not yet finished, which may or may not culminate in a value.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Deferred<T = any> 
```

## Example


```ts
// The Deferred represents some work to be done
const d = new Deferred<number>();

// in this case, we're accumulating timestamps
const timestamps: Date[] = [];

// ever
const task = setInterval(() => {
  timestamps.push(new Date());
}, 100);

d.promise.then(val => {
 console.log('work is complete!', val)
});

```
